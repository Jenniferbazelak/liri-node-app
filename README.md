# liri-node-app

## What do we have here?

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How does it work?

Type in "node liri" followed by one of the following commands:

* "movie-this" then the movie of your choice. This will render the following information about each event to the terminal: Title of the movie, Year the movie came out, IMDB Rating of the movie, Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie, Country where the movie was produced, Language of the movie and Plot of the movie.

* "concert-this" then the artist/band of your choice. This will render the following information about each event to the terminal: venue, location and date.

* "spotify-this-song" then the song of you choice. This will render the following information about each event to the terminal: artist(s), song name, preview link and album name.

* "do-what-it-says" This will pull information from the random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
